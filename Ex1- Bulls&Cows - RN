 * Ex1 Bulls & Cows - Automatic solution.
 * Author: Roy Naor
 * ID: 323917104
 * ** README **
 * This Java class provides an automated and manual solutions to the game "Bulls and Cows".
 * The game is based on logic where the player needs to guess a secret number based on result returned for each guess.
 * The result is given in terms of "Bulls", representing correct digits in their correct positions,
 * and "Cows", correct digits but in the wrong positions.
 * The goal is to guess the secret number with as few guesses as possible

 * **** General Solution (algorithm) ****
 * The algorithm is based on a boolean array that his length is equal to the maximum possible numbers there are
 * between zero and ten in the power of number of digits of the code (0 < num < 10 ** number of digits)
 * every value at the start is TRUE, The reason is: every number in the array can be the secret code until the
 * algorithm prove it's not the secret code so the value change to FALSE.
 * The algorithm use the properties of Class "BP_Game" to extract the number of digits in the code.
 * After extracting the number of digits the method "autoEx1Game" create the boolean array "possibleNumbers" and Fill it
 * using the "Arrays" Class with TRUE. The main loop the method use is While. Using one of the "BP_Game" methods
 * called "isRunning" the method can run over and over until "isRunning" return FALSE.
 * Within the while loop in "autoEx1Game",the algorithm generates a guess for the secret code.
 * This is by calling the "NextGuess" method,
 * which loop over the possibleNumbers array and selects the next number that is still TRUE.
 * The selected number is then transformed into an array of its digits using the "toArray" method.
 * This digit array is the current guess. The guess is then submitted to the BP_Server game,
 * then returns the count of Bulls and Cows. After receiving the Bulls and Cows count,
 * the algorithm updates the "possibleNumbers" array using the "updateGuess" method.
 * This method loops over each number in the "possibleNumbers" array
 * and determines if it could produce the same Bulls and Cows count as the current guess.
 * If a number would produce a different count, it is marked as FALSE in the "possibleNumbers" array.

 * **** Results ****
 * Make sure to state the average required guesses
 * for 2,3,4,5,6 digit code:
 * Average required guesses 2: 7.24
 * Average required guesses 3: 7.94
 * Average required guesses 4: 8.79
 * Average required guesses 5: 9.02
 * Average required guesses 6: 9.49
